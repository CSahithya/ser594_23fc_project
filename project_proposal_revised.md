**Keywords:** Crime Prediction, Socioeconomic Factors, Crime Patterns

**Description:** 
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying *factors that affect* criminal activity in the United States, using a combination of historical crime data and socioeconomic factors. *Specifically, predict how a change in socioeconomic factor can effect the crime rate of a state.* This project aims to answer questions: How is education/literacy affecting crime rates? *To achieve less crime rates which factor should be the focus of the state?*

**Research Objectives** </br>
_Research Objective 1_: To describe the trends within the values of socio-economic factors and crime rates. </br>
_Research Objective 2_: To predict the value of the crime for a change in the socio-economic factor for a state.</br>
_Research Objective 3_: To defend the model for performing the predictions in _RO2_.</br>
_Research Objective 4_: To evaluate casual relationships implied by the _RO2_ model.</br>
_Research Objective 5_: To analyze if the model can be used to predict values for a smaller area as opposed to a state. 

**Intellectual Merit:**
The project's intellectual strength resides in its capacity to produce information on the elements that contribute to criminal behavior and the model's capacity for accurate prediction. I want to find hidden patterns and linkages that support efforts to avoid crime by fusing historical crime data with socioeconomic factors. Reducing crime rates and enhancing community safety and well-being can both benefit from the capacity *to identify what factors effect the crime in what proportion*.

**Data Sourcing:**
To conduct this research, I will collect crime data, socioeconomic data, such as income levels, education levels, and unemployment rates, from authoritative sources like data.gov or statista.com or other official sites. The datasets used are:
1. [Population by State in the US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183497/population-in-the-federal-states-of-the-us/)
2. [Annual Unemployment rate by state in US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/223675/state-unemployment-rate-in-the-us/)
3. [US real per capita GDP by state in US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/248063/per-capita-us-real-gross-domestic-product-gdp-by-state/)
4. [Number of Executions in US by state](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271100/number-of-executions-in-the-us/)
5. [Number of murders involving firearms by state in US](https://www.statista.com/statistics/301603/murder-involving-firearms-us/)
6. [Mass shootings in US by state](https://www.statista.com/statistics/811541/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-state/)
7. [Gun Law strength in US by state](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1358692/leading-states-gun-law-strength-us/)
8. [US literacy rates by state](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/us-literacy-rates-by-state)

**Background Knowledge:** 
This dataset and the project are straightforward. We don't require any specific background knowledge. Although the following identified resources are informative:
