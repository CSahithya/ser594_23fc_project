**Keywords:** Crime Prediction, Socioeconomic Factors, Crime Patterns

**Description:** 
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying areas with a high likelihood of criminal activity in the United States, using a combination of historical crime data and socioeconomic factors. This project aims to answer questions: How is education/literacy affecting crime rates? How is well-being influencing crimes?

**Intellectual Merit:**
The project's intellectual strength resides in its capacity to produce information on the elements that contribute to criminal behavior and the model's capacity for accurate prediction. I want to find hidden patterns and linkages that support efforts to avoid crime by fusing historical crime data with socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. Reducing crime rates and enhancing community safety and well-being can both benefit from the capacity to identify high-crime locations correctly.

**Data Sourcing:**
To conduct this research, I plan to obtain relevant data from various sources, including the "Crime Data from 2020 to Present" and other datasets provided by Data.gov. Additionally, I will collect socioeconomic data, such as income levels, education levels, and unemployment rates, from authoritative sources like data.gov or other official sites.

**Background Knowledge:** 
This dataset and the project are straightforward. We don't require any specific background knowledge. Although the following identified resources are informative:
